# use Qt 5
Since Qt 6 doesn't support  Windows 7 or 8.x version, you will run into problems with the latest version of `openconnect-sso`.
# Wintun driver installation
The driver is not automatically installed, so you need to install it separately. There are 2 ways to do so:  

1. Download OpenVPN GUI from http://staging.openvpn.net/openvpn2/ and when you install it, check only the Wintun driver installation  
2. Run the wintun.bat install script from our software's "Tap" subfolder (e.g. C:\Program Files (x86)\VPN.AC Client\Tap)
